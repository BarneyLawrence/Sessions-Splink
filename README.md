# Sessions-Splink

A repository holding resources and presentations relating to Record Linkage in general and the Python package [Splink](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/).

Past presentations are in sub folders. Latest work is at the top level.

Splink v3 and v4 demos have been tested in both Microsoft Fabric and Synapse Analytics.

The ipynb files in the Festive Tech Calendar folder are exports from our Synapse notebooks, great for importing back into Synapse.

The py files are python conversions of our Synapse notebooks. Good if you want to copy and paste the code into another type of Spark (although will likely need some faffing around with to get working).

Videos of past sessions:

* [Splinking in a Winter Wonderland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ijNR3V4v3w) - Produced for Festive Tech Calendar 2023 - Lots of detail on splink v3 and statistical backing. Also hats.
