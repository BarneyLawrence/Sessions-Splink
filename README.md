# Sessions-Splink

Repository holding resources and presentations relating to the record linkage Python package Splink.


The ipynb files are exports from our Synapse notebooks, great for importing back into Synapse.

The py files are python conversions of our Synapse notebooks. Good if you want to copy and past the code into another type of Spark (although will likely need some faffing around with to get working).
